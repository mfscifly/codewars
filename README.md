# Codewars
This repository is a collection of my solutions to daily code challenges from <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a>. It is organized by levels or "kyu" - the lower the kyu number, the harder the challenge. Currently in the top 14% globally, pushing solutions every day.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

## Optimizations:

Once the challenge is solved, I will refactor my code to be more efficient and readable. I will also study others' answers to the problem. At times I will provide a second solution to practice thinking about problems in a different way.

## Lessons Learned:

Consistency is important for keeping your problem solving and analytical skills sharp. Continuously learning is very important to me, so every morning I complete one of these challenges. At times they are tricky and require me to look up a new method, and that is part of the fun!
