# Codewars
This repository is a collection of my solutions to daily code challenges from <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a>. It is organized by levels or "kyu" - the lower the kyu number, the harder the challenge. Currently in the top 39% globally, pushing solutions every day.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations:

Once the challenge is solved, I will refactor my code to be more efficient and readable. I will also study others' answers to the problem. At times I will provide a second solution to practice thinking about problems in a different way.

## Lessons Learned:

Consistency is important for keeping your problem solving and analytical skills sharp. Continuously learning is very important to me, so every morning I complete one of these challenges. At times they are tricky and require me to look up a new method, and that is part of the fun!
